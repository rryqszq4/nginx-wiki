Slice
=====

Synopsis 
--------
This is a module that is distributed with `Tengine <http://tengine.taobao.org>`_ which is a distribution of NGINX that is used by the e-commerce/auction site `Taobao.com <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taobao>`_. This distribution contains some modules that are new on the NGINX scene. The ``ngx_http_slice_module`` module is one of them.

This module can be thought out as a **reverse byte-range** request header. It's main utility is to allow NGINX to slice a big file in small pieces (byte-ranges) while permitting to use on-the-fly gzip compression.

A typical example is for allowing someone to download a large video file while keeping the bandwith usage minimal. This might also be used as device for selling a video file by pieces where each link points to different zones of the file splitted by file ranges.

Other use would be to use a generic CSS file and use only part of it for each section of a site. Granted that byte-range slicing isn't the most intuitive for such.

Note also that using arguments is more **useful** than byte-ranges in the sense that they can be set in a normal link, while byte ranges require a special `HTTP header <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_serving>`_.

Configuration example:

.. code-block:: nginx

  location ^~ /video-dump/ {
      slice; # enable slicing
      slice_start_arg s;
      slice_end_arg e;    
  }


So we would request the first 1k of the file like this::

  http://example.com/video-dump/large_vid.mp4?s=0&e=1024

.. note:: ``s=0``, start at *0* and ``e=1024``, stop at *1024* bytes (1k).

Directives
----------

slice
^^^^^
:Syntax: *slice*
:Default: *none*
:Context: *location*

It enables the content slicing in a given location.


slice_arg_begin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Syntax: *slice_arg_begin string*
:Default: *start*
:Context: *http, server, location*

Defines the argument that defines the request range of bytes *start*.


slice_arg_end
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Syntax: *slice_arg_end string*
:Default: *end*
:Context: *http, server, location*

Defines the argument that defines the request range of bytes *end*.


slice_header
^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Syntax: *slice_header string*
:Default: *none*
:Context: *http, server, location*

Defines the string to be used as the *header* of each slice being served by NGINX.


slice_footer
^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Syntax: *slice_footer string*
:Default: *none*
:Context: *http, server, location*

Defines the string to be used as the *footer* of each slice being served by NGINX.


slice_header_first
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Syntax: *slice_header_first [on|off]*
:Default: *on*
:Context: *http, server, location*

If set to ``off`` and when requesting the *first* byte of the file *do not* serve the header.

This directive is particularly useful to differentiate the *first* slice from the remaining slices. The first slice is the one which has no header.


slice_footer_last
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Syntax: *slice_footer_last [on|off]*
:Default: *on*
:Context: *http, server, location*

If set to ``off`` and when requesting the *last* bytes of the file *do not* serve the header.

This directive is particularly useful to differentiate the *last* slice from the remaining slices. The last slice is the one which has no footer.



Examples
--------
Here're some examples that explore all the options.

1. **Serve a huge DB file while sending headers except on the first slice**

  .. code-block:: nginx

    location ^~ /dbdumps/ {
        slice; # enable slicing
        slice_start_arg first;
        slice_end_arg last;
        slice_header '-- **db-slice-start**';
        slice_header_first off;
    }


  Then a request like this::

    http://example.com/dbdumps/somedb.sql?first=0&last=1048576

  Send the first 1M and skip the ``*-- **db-slice-start*** header``.

2. **Serve a huge DB file while sending headers except on the first slice**

  .. code-block:: nginx

    location ^~ /dbdumps/ {
        slice; # enable slicing
        slice_start_arg first;
        slice_end_arg last;
        slice_header '-- **db-slice-start**';
        slice_header_first off;
        slice_footer '-- **db-slice-end**';
    }


  This differs from the previous in the sense that it sends a footer.

3. **Serve a huge DB file while sending headers except on the first slice and send footer except on the last slice**

  .. code-block:: nginx

    location ^~ /dbdumps/ {
        slice; # enable slicing
        slice_start_arg first;
        slice_end_arg last;
        slice_header '-- **db-slice-start**';
        slice_header_first off;
        slice_footer '-- **db-slice-end**';
        slice_footer_last off; 
    }


  Then a request like this::

    http://example.com/dbdumps/somedb.sql?first=0&last=1048576

  Send the first 1M and skip the ``*-- **db-slice-start*** header``.
  
  If the file is 200MB, we get the last slice with::

    http://example.com/dbdumps/somedb.sql?first=208666624&last=209715200
 
  this last slice has no footer.



Installation
------------
#. Clone the git repo.
   git clone git://github.com/taobao/nginx-http-slice.git
#. Add the module to the build configuration by adding:

  .. code-block:: bash

     --add-module=/path/to/nginx-http-slice
   
#. Build the NGINX binary.
#. Install the NGINX binary.
#. Configure contexts where concat is enabled.
#. Build your links such that the above format, i.e., all URIs that correspond to specific ranges. As example here's how to link to the first 4k of a file:

  .. code-block:: html
   
     <a href="http://example.com/datadumps/dump0.sql?start=0&end=4096"/>db dump</a>
   
#. Done.



Tagging releases 
----------------
I'm tagging each release in synch with the `Tengine <http://tengine.taobao.org>`_ releases.



Other tengine modules on Github
-------------------------------
* :github:`http concat <taobao/nginx-http-concat>`
    Allows to concatenate a given set of files and ship a single response from the server. It's particularly useful for **aggregating** CSS and Javascript files.
* :github:`footer filter <taobao/nginx-http-footer-filter>`
    Allows to add some extra data (markup or not) at the end of a request body. It's pratical for things like adding time stamps or other miscellaneous stuff without having to tweak your application.



Other builds
------------
* As referred at the outset this module is part of the `*Tengine* <http://tengine.taobao.org>`_ NGINX distribution. So you might want to save yourself some work and just build it from scratch using *tengine* in lieu if the official NGINX source.
* If you fancy a bleeding edge NGINX package (from the dev releases) for Debian made to measure then you might be interested in my `debian <http://debian.perusio.net/unstable>`_ NGINX package. Instructions for using the repository and making the package live happily inside a stable distribution installation are `provided <http://debian.perusio.net>`_.
